Fake News Prediction

Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a news article is real or fake. The
project is implemented entirely in Jupyter notebooks, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques 
and machine learning algorithms to classify news articles.


01_data_exploration.ipynb: Explore the dataset, clean, and preprocess the data.

02_model_training.ipynb: Train the machine learning model using the processed data.

03_evaluation.ipynb: Evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset.


The dataset i used were from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv
